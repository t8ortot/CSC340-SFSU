# Programming Methodology

This is my coursework from my Programming Methodology course I took in Fall 2017 at San Francisco State University.

Projects include, in order:
- Player Roster
- Word Counter
- Dynamic Array Example
- Word Pair Counter
- VectorADT and ListADT Examples
- Person Employee Example

Due to hard drive failure, some projects from the beginning of this course are missing.

I am withholding the course ID from this repo to avoid plagiarism from current and future attending students.

Disclaimer: These projects were coded without utilizing GitHub, therefore there are not many commits involving development in this repo.
